# Node x Express

This repository contains a basic Express application built with JavaScript that utilizes Node.js for server-side functionality. It is configured with Nodemon for automatic server restarts during development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js - Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system.
- npm - npm is the package manager for Node.js and comes with the Node.js installation.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/c99rahul/ts-node-express.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd ts-node-express/
```

Install the project dependencies:

```
npm i
```

Now, switch the the `javascript` branch to see the JavaScript-only example for a basic Express-Node server:

```
git switch javascript
```

## Usage

This part is just to examplify how easy it is to start a minimal Express server on Node. To see it in action, run `node src/index.js` file in the terminal and you should see the server up and running.
